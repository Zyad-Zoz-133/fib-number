# 🔢 Fibonacci Sequence Generator

An interactive C++ console application that generates and formats the famous **Fibonacci Sequence** up to a user-defined position ($n$). The program handles large numerical values safely using extended integer types and structures the output inside a clean, readable array format.

## **🛠️ Development Tools**

This project was built and managed using:
* **VS Code:** The text editor used for writing and formatting the source code.
* **GCC / MinGW Compiler:** Used to compile the C++ code into an executable program.
* **Git & GitHub:** Used for local version control and cloud repository hosting.

---

## **Key Features**

* **Array-Style Formatting:** Outputs the sequence inside stylized brackets `[0, 1, 1, 2, ...]` for an elegant CLI presentation.
* **Large Number Support:** Utilizes `long long` data types to prevent integer overflow as the sequence grows exponentially.
* **Basic Input Validation:** Built-in guard clauses to intercept invalid positions ($n \le 0$) and gracefully output an error message.

## **Technical Breakdown**

### **The Fibonacci Logic**
The Fibonacci sequence is a mathematical series where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with $0$ and $1$. 
The mathematical recurrence relation is defined as:

$$F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$$

With seed values:
* $F_0 = 0$
* $F_1 = 1$

### **Algorithmic Efficiency**
Instead of using heavy recursion which can slow down the system (with a time complexity of $O(2^n)$), this implementation uses an **Iterative Approach** with a loop. It dynamically swaps three variables (`a`, `b`, and `c`) to calculate the next terms in linear time ($O(n)$ complexity), making it highly optimized and fast.
